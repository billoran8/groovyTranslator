groovyTranslator
==========================

i wanted a programatic tool that could be used to create a cool sounding fantasy language that was replicatable but more complicated than a simple caesar cipher.

put in an english language corpus (reference corpus)
put in a cool sounding language corpus (modify corpus)
put in a phrase to translate

every time the phrase is translated, it will be the same so long as the two sample corpuses are, but the language is cooler and not as simple
